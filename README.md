# Enable cryptocurrency in FUNDING.yml

This repository is to show the interest that the community has in adding cryptocurrencies as a funding platform for GitHub Sponsors. Star this repo if you'd like to see cryptocurrencies added as official options to the FUNDING.yml file for GitHub Sponsors.

## Proposal

This proposal focuses on the two most popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum. More could come, but adding these two would be a great start. The proposal is as follows:

Add `bitcion` and `ethereum` fields to the `FUNDINY.yml` file for GitHub Sponsors.

In addition to the platforms already available in the `FUNDING.yml` file, add the following:

| Platform | Syntax |
| --- | --- |
| Bitcoin | `bitcoin: ADDRESS` |
| Ethereum | `ethereum: ADDRESS` |
